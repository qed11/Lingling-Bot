# Lingling-Bot
A machine learning model that allows multi-musical instrument identification for 14 classical instruments from audio files under 30 seconds. 

Lingling Bot enables the identification of classical musical instruments that are being played in a sound file. It has an accuracy of ~82% for multi-instrument identification with the current sound database of <30 second wav files. Our strong interest in music, specifically classical music, is what motivated us to choose to do this project. Other than just simple pure interest in music, our project can also be useful in a variety of ways. For example, Lingling Bot can be used in an educational setting to teach music students how to identify both individual and combinations of instruments from their sound.
